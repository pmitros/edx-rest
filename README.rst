edx-rest
========

This library provides a Python API to edX REST APIs. Most of the APIs
it calls are designed for AJAX, and unsupported by edX. This make
break at any point in time.

This library was created for helping manage the flipped session track
at Learning at Scale. We had about 30 authors express interest in
participating in this. About half of them requested access to create
digital resources for such courses.
